# Getting Started with 
# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game Description
Objective
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where the objective is to be the first to get three of your symbols (either X or O) in a row on a 3x3 grid. The rows can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

Players
Player 1: Uses the symbol X
Player 2: Uses the symbol O
Gameplay
Setup: The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

Starting the Game: Decide who goes first. Players can choose by mutual agreement, a coin toss, or any other method.

Taking Turns: Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) in one of the empty squares on the grid. Player 1 usually goes first.

Winning the Game: The game is won by the first player to get three of their symbols in a row. The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

Draw: If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is considered a draw.

Strategies
Offensive Strategy: Aim to create a row of three symbols while also blocking your opponent from doing so.
Defensive Strategy: Focus on blocking your opponent's moves to prevent them from getting three in a row.
